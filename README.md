### HR-Analytics-Dashboard

# Introduction

Welcome, This is a comprehensive human resources analysis report created using Power BI Desktop. The project showcase my analytics prowess in delving into key metrics and data visualizations pertinent to employee demographics and statistics within an organization. This is a dumy data and does not represent any business organization. 

# Problem Statement

After observing the data, the main issue was to effectively monitor and analyze its workforce data so as to identify trends and issues related to employee demographics, satisfaction, and attrition, in order to implement strategic HR interventions that improve employee retention, satisfaction, and overall organizational performance.

# Data Analysis Process

Data Extration: HR data was extracted using the get dat function in Power Bi.
Data Transformation: The loaded data was cleaned and pre- processed to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats. Then the data was finally loaded. 
Data Analysis: Analyzing the cleaned data to extract insights, identify trends, and detect patterns. This included calculating key metrics like attrition rates, average age, and gender distribution. All these were done using DAX. 
Dashboard Design and Development: Designing the dashboard layout and selecting appropriate visualization types (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to represent the analyzed data effectively.

# Interactive Dashboard

After thorough analysis, I created an interactive dashboard that showcased:
- Employee demographics and attrition rates 
- Department-wise distribution and job roles
- Job and environmental satisfaction across various positions

This is a two page dashboard showing the general overview and the HR Analysis in details.
